# Git for Beginners

This is a collection of two batch scripts to give Git beginners prompts to follow and tells them the commands as it executes the commands for them.

prepare-for-work.bat downloads the remote repo and merges it into their local repo, or helps them clone a new one.
upload.bat helps them add all the files to the staging area and commit and push with lightweight version tags if necessary.
